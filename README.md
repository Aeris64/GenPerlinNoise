# GenPerlinNoise Project

## Using library
- [SFML](https://github.com/SFML/sfml)
- [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)
- [SimplexNoise](https://github.com/SRombauts/SimplexNoise)

## Project
The project generates via a perlin noise a random terrain in 2D view (Mario).
It is possible to change the main parameters of the noise by going to the Game.cpp.
It is also possible to add plans (2D only for the moment) via the JSON file "plans.json" in `resources/plans.json`.
